# opensketchbook
a selection of pre-damaged sketchbook pages for your inspiration and modification, by Allan Haverholm http://haverholm.com

I'm a firm believer in constraints as an inspirational assistance, and so I started a new sketchbook by pasting found paper scraps on all righthand pages. The scraps are more or less aligned to a comic strip grid of two or three even-sized panels (included here as an optional add-on for others who might want to use the sketchbook for comics).
Having pasted it all up,I decided to scan the book for others to build/sketch on, and here we are.
